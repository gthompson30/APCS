1. if next value < root of maxheap, add to maxheap
   else add to minheap
2. balance heaps (size difference <2):
    (remove from larger heap, add to smaller until balanced)
3. at any time, find med by
    a) heap sizes equal: med is mean of roots
    b) heap sizes !equal: med is root of larger heap
