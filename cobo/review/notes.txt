4. In our implementation, we first split the file content into each component word, and store this in an array.
   We also initialize a "counter" that stores the current sentiment value total. We then iterate through each
   item of this array (each word). In each iteration, we store a copy of the word without punctuation, using
   the removePunctuation() function, calculate its sentimentVal(), and add this to the total sentiment value.
   We then return the total sentiment value at the end of the function.

5. No, they do not. Longer reviews get measured as more extremely positive or negative.
