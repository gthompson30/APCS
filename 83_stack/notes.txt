For the warm up, we took out our encapsulation diagrams.
The kevins presented their diagram, which received much critique from mr mykolyk
Three teams tried to diagram their push and pop operations. Two failed, but third time was the charm
We discussed whether to push/pop from the left or the right, and discussed the time complexities of each
We discussed the role of the size variable
Practical applications of stacks:
 - Recursion
 - Reversing strings
 - Matching parenthesis
 - Grocery stores??? (thanks Kartik)
We then discussed how to reverse a string with stacks
