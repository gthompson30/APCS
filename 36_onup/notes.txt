Types of errors:
 * Compile-time error -- An error that prevents the Java code from compiling. Indicates that the basic
   syntax of the program is incorrect.
 * Run-time error -- An error that occurs during the execution of the program. Indicates that the code is
   doing something that the computer can't process
 * Logical error -- A term used to describe the program doing something unintended, rather than a code error
   being yielded.

How to fix compile-time errors:
 * Look at the first error (i.e. or the one that could be causing the others)
 * Acknowledge that not the number of error messages â‰  the number of errors
 * Check for common errors (not using semicolons, referencing static from non-static, etc.), listed below.
 * Use critical thinking to decide if the compiler is giving you good error solutions

How to fix run-time errors:
 * TBW

How to fix logic errors:
 * TBW

Go(o)d advice:
 * Use line numbers / file names to identify the place in the code that causes the error
 * Indent the program properly, so it's easier to search for errors
 * print out values of variables liberally (and use visualizer)
 * Make sure you're actually compiling the file you're editing. Check this by making obvious errors and
   seeing if appropriate compilation error is outputted

Trickiest error messages:
 * Parenthesis / bracket misalignment
 * Case-sensitivity
 * Not using semicolon / using semicolon after bracket
 * Not using double quotes for Strings and single quotes for chars
 * Not having var name on left and value on right
 * Function/constructor arguments in the wrong order
 * Wrong return type / not returning something for a non-void return type
 * Use dot notation when invoking static methods
 * Only reference static from static and you must use "this." to refer to non-static from static
